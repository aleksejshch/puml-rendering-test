    component "DAC" as DAC
    component "SPI" as SPI
    component "HW Timer" as Timer

TestThread --> StreamThread : uses
StreamThread --> DAC : writes data
DAC --> SPI : sends data
StreamThread --> Timer : starts/stops

    - Uses message queue (msgq)
    - Implements ping-pong buffering
    - Manages DAC operations
end note
